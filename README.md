# Global-Model
A rough model of our world

A model of the world's GPD that includes a couple of the major economic externalities such as climate change using the IPCC model, as well as possible positive scenarios such as leaps in education, family planning and/or working fusion reactors. I'd like to make an interactive display in a notebook or website with sliders for the major parameters. In turn, this could be used to identify the largest areas of uncertainty to put more research toward and optimize programs which are improve the global standard of living the most.

I'm aware of the short comings of GDP, and of other indicators (HDI, Sustainability and Happiness), but GDP seems like a good place to start. Max Rosen has done an amazing job at thoroughly describing some global data at [OurWorldinData](https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth). Another good starting point is [The Limits to Growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth), a [public model](https://insightmaker.com/tag/Limits-To-Growth) of it and the 30 year follow up analysis.

I've started a Kernel plotting the GDP projections here: https://www.kaggle.com/auwsom/gdp-to-2060-world-plot

And here's a Discussion on Kaggle regarding the project: https://www.kaggle.com/general/77023
